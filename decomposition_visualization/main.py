## Introduction

This report presents the results of applying wavelet transform to digital images. The analysis includes:
- Single-level wavelet decomposition with different wavelet bases
- Multi-level wavelet decomposition
- Hierarchical visualization of wavelet coefficients
- Coefficient thresholding for noise reduction

## Methodology

The implementation follows these steps:
1. Load and preprocess the image
2. Apply wavelet decomposition using PyWavelets
3. Visualize the wavelet coefficients
4. Reconstruct the image using inverse wavelet transform
5. Calculate quality metrics (MSE and PSNR)
6. Apply thresholding to wavelet coefficients

## Results

### 1. Wavelet Decomposition with Different Bases

The analysis compares Haar and Daubechies (db2) wavelets for image decomposition. 

- **Haar Wavelet**: Provides the simplest wavelet transform with sharp transitions
- **Daubechies Wavelet (db2)**: Offers smoother transitions and better frequency localization

### 2. Multi-Level Decomposition

The multi-level decomposition shows how:
- Higher decomposition levels capture increasingly coarser approximations
- Each level reveals different frequency structures in the image
- Detail coefficients highlight different edge orientations

### 3. Hierarchical Visualization

The hierarchical arrangement of coefficients demonstrates the multi-resolution nature of wavelet transform, with:
- Approximation coefficients in the top-left corner
- Detail coefficients arranged by level and orientation
- Different scales showing features at varying resolutions

### 4. Coefficient Thresholding

Thresholding the wavelet coefficients demonstrates:
- Noise reduction potential of wavelets
- Trade-off between noise suppression and preservation of image details
- Impact of threshold value on reconstruction quality

## Conclusion

The wavelet transform provides an effective multi-resolution analysis for images. The choice of wavelet basis and decomposition level significantly affects the representation of image features. Additionally, coefficient thresholding offers a simple yet effective approach to image denoising.
