## Analysis and Results

### Downsampling Methods

1. Direct Pixel Deletion:
   - Fastest method but lowest quality
   - Can introduce aliasing artifacts
   - Best used when speed is critical and quality is less important
   - More noticeable quality loss at higher downsampling factors

2. Interpolation-based Downsampling:
   - Better quality but slower than direct deletion
   - Reduces aliasing artifacts
   - Preserves more image details
   - Recommended for most applications

### Upsampling Methods

1. Nearest Neighbor:
   - Fastest method
   - Creates blocky artifacts
   - Preserves sharp edges but poor for smooth transitions
   - Suitable for pixel art or when blocky appearance is desired

2. Bilinear Interpolation:
   - Good balance between speed and quality
   - Smoother results than nearest neighbor
   - Some blur in high-frequency details
   - Recommended for real-time applications

3. Bicubic Interpolation:
   - Best quality but slowest method
   - Preserves details better than bilinear
   - Can introduce ringing artifacts
   - Recommended for final image processing

### Quality Metrics

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
   - Lower values indicate better quality
   - More sensitive to large differences
   - Not always correlating with visual quality

2. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):
   - Higher values indicate better quality
   - Measured in decibels (dB)
   - Values above 30 dB generally indicate good quality

### Best Practices

1. For 2x Downsampling:
   - Use interpolation-based method with bicubic interpolation
   - Provides best balance of quality and performance
   - Minimal visible artifacts

2. For 4x Downsampling:
   - Use interpolation-based method with bilinear or bicubic
   - Consider two-pass approach for better quality
   - Monitor for aliasing artifacts

3. For 8x Downsampling:
   - Use interpolation-based method with anti-aliasing
   - Consider multi-pass approach
   - Quality loss becomes significant

4. For Upsampling:
   - Use bicubic for final images
   - Use bilinear for real-time applications
   - Use nearest neighbor only when pixelation is desired

### Performance Considerations

1. Processing Time:
   - Direct pixel deletion: Fastest
   - Nearest neighbor: Very fast
   - Bilinear: Moderate
   - Bicubic: Slowest

2. Memory Usage:
   - All methods use similar memory
   - Multi-pass approaches require more memory
   - Consider batch processing for large images
