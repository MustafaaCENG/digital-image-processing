# Digital Image Processing Course Projects 🖼️

This repository contains my work and implementations for the Digital Image Processing course. The projects focus on various fundamental concepts and techniques in digital image processing, implemented in Python.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different modules, each focusing on specific aspects of image processing:

### 1. Image Enhancement
- Located in `/image_enhancement/`
- Implements various image enhancement techniques
- Features histogram equalization, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction
- Includes sample images and results
- Detailed documentation in the module's README

### 2. Spatial Filtering
- Located in `/spatial_filtering/`
- Implementation of various spatial domain filters
- Includes smoothing and sharpening filters
- Contains test images and example results
- Comprehensive documentation in the module's README

### 2. Spatial Filtering
- Located in `/resolution_interpolation/`
- Comprehensive documentation in the module's README


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Claude.ai Cursor 3.7-sonnet
- Additional dependencies listed in each module's `requirements.txt`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MustafaaCENG/digital-image-processing.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Navigate to specific module directories to run the implementations:
```bash
cd image_enhancement
# or
cd spatial_filtering
```

4. Follow the specific README instructions in each module for detailed usage.
