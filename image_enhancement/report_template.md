# Image Enhancement Report

## Introduction

This report summarizes the methods, experiments, and findings from implementing and analyzing point operations for image enhancement, specifically gamma correction and histogram equalization.

## Methods

### Gamma Correction

Gamma correction is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance in images. The power-law transformation is applied as:

```
output = input^gamma
```

Where:
- Gamma < 1: Brightens darker regions (useful for underexposed images)
- Gamma > 1: Darkens brighter regions (useful for overexposed images)
- Gamma = 1: No change

### Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast. The process involves:

1. Computing the histogram of the input image
2. Calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
3. Normalizing the CDF to create a mapping function
4. Applying the mapping to create the equalized image

## Experiments

### Gamma Correction Results

[Describe the results of applying different gamma values to various images. Include observations about how gamma affects brightness and contrast in different types of images.]

### Histogram Equalization Results

[Describe the results of applying histogram equalization to various images. Include observations about how the pixel intensity distribution changes and how this affects image quality.]

### Combined Operations

[Describe the results of applying operations in different sequences:
1. Gamma correction followed by histogram equalization
2. Histogram equalization followed by gamma correction

Include observations about how the order affects the final result.]

### Case Studies

#### Underexposed Image

[Include results and analysis for the underexposed image]
